### 1.6

- Add `--filter` to `import-jobs` to allow importing jobs to specific environments. In the case where people maintain jobs in the dbt Cloud UI and want to promote them, they can mention what environments they want to import the jobs to using the identifier of the job: `[[envs_filter:identifier]]`.

### 1.5

- Add `--json` to `plan` and `sync` to output the `stdout` changes in JSON format. This can be useful for automating some processes and consuming the changes from scripts. We are still printing logs to `stderr` though, so to remove those logs you can redirect `stderr` to `/dev/null` or redirect `stdout` to a file and then read from the file.

### 1.4

- Add `--templated-fields` to `import-jobs` to add Jinja variables to the generated YAML file. This can be useful to allow users to maintain jobs in the dbt Cloud UI and set a process to automatically promote those to other environments.

### 1.3

- Add this docs site
- Add `--managed-only` flag to the `import` command to only import managed jobs
- Add `--environment-id` and `--project-id` flags to `link`, `unlink` and `deactivate-jobs` commands

### 1.2

- Automatically set the identifier when using `import-jobs` on managed jobs. This automatically links the jobs to the generated YAML file.

### 1.1

- Add the ability to mention "glob" files for the YAML config and var files.
    - i.e. `dbt-jobs-as-code plan ".dbt/jobs/*"` can be used to take into consideration all files in the `.dbt/jobs` directory.

### 1.0

- Initial release of `1.0`
